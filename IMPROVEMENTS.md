# Markup for improvments

## 1. Credintals for viewing

> The mockup instructions describe it as as a security protocole. One of the features that I would implement is a passcode functionality to allow access to the emails. The passcode feature can be initiatied on the selection of first email or on the inital site entrance. After the user logins the password credentials will passed around to the specified pages so login is a one time requirement.

## 2. Search filter by text

> Implenting a search feature that includes text would speed up the search process and allow the user to locate emails with specific email adresses or subjects. This will inturn allow user to narrow down the the results in a more detailed fashon.

## 3. Color and Font

- Adjustments the color scheme to be more appealing to the eyes of the user. In the case of a security breach, the user could be a interating witth the sight for long periods of time and with white being the primary color it can have negitive effects on the users eyes.

- Font style can enhance the importance of the application and it security measures devlepming an inportance in thought and detail of the the task at hand.

## 4. Folder Creation

> Adding the above functionality will allow users to organize and catorigorize emails based on the users prefernce to make the work load more manageable and efficent.

## 5. Recently Searched

> Having a recent history auto fill for previously searched items will again speed up the process to locate emails. If a time range selected as already been searched for.

## 6. Pages

> Instead of an endless scroll I would recomend a page count that loads a specified amount of emails per page. In the case of a large body of emails that need to be pulled down then it could help with loading times.

## 7. 'of' and Numbers

- Just having numbers such as 1 of 10 can have the same impact as having the actual word 'Results # mail(s)' . It has the same impact and less of the akwardness of having the mails(s) element to play on the multiple emails or one email.

- If writing out the word Results was a non optional then I would recomend having the number it self in a more poping color such as orange. Other colors are usefull but orange pops and is warm and inviting.
