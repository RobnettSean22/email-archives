# Markup for improvements

## 1. Credentials for viewing

> The mockup instructions say it is a security protocole to retrive emails. One of the features that I would put in is a login befor the user has access to the emails. The login feature can be initiatied on the selection of first email or on the inital site entrance. After the user logins the password crednetials will passed around to the pages that require it, so login is a one-time thing.

## 2. Search filter by text

> Implenting a search feature that includes text would speed up the search process and allow the user to locate emails with specific email adresses or subjects. This will inturn allow users to narrow down the results quicker.

## 3. Color

- Adjustments to the color scheme might make more appealing to the eyes of the user. In the case of a security breach, the user could be a interacting with the sight for long periods of time and with white being the primary color it can have negitive effects on the users eyes.

## 4. Folder Creation

> Adding the above functionality will allow users to organize and catorigorize emails based on the users prefernce to make the workload more manageable and efficent.

## 5. Recently Searched

> Having a recent history auto fill for previously searched items will again speed up the process to locate emails. If a time range selected as already been searched for.

## 6. Pages

> Instead of an endless scroll I would recomend a page count that loads a specified amount of emails per page. In the case of a large body of emails that need to be pulled down then it could help with loading times.

## 7. 'of' and Numbers

- Just having numbers such as 1 of 10 can have the same impact as having the actual word 'Results # mail(s). It has the same impact and less of the akwardness of having the mails(s) element to play on the multiple emails or one email.

- If writing out the word Results was a non optional then I would recomend having the number it self in a more poping color such as orange. Other colors are usefull but orange pops and is warm and inviting.
